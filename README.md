# SIF_demo_BGC

There are two types of demo program files in this repository, 
Files ending in ipynb are the mainly experimental processes in drought monitoring research using SIF.
Files ending in pro are some sample IDL files during meteorological drought monitoring research.

Note that the above documents are all actual records of my research experiments and they are without 
any modification, the grammar and format may not up to the standard, but the functionality is not affected, 
those files are only for display my research capabilites by using mainstream tools and programming language 
on March25,2020 MPI-BGC interview.
